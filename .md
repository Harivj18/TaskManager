🤖 AI-Powered Task Suggestions
The AI model provides smart recommendations to help users prioritize and manage their tasks efficiently. It analyzes:

Task deadlines
Current workload

User activity history
To fetch AI-powered suggestions, the backend calls OpenAI’s API and returns optimized task management recommendations.
